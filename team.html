                    Bibi is someone who finds deep comfort and excitement in stories.
                    Whether through books or movies, she enjoys stepping into worlds
                    beyond her own and exploring emotions, ideas, and experiences
                    through fictional characters.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Reading is more than just a hobby—it’s her escape and creative fuel.
                    Each book feels like a quiet adventure, allowing her imagination
                    to wander freely and reflect on life in gentle, meaningful ways.
                </p>

                <p>
                    She has a soft spot for cats, calming music, and films that balance
                    romance, humour, and action. Movies that make her laugh, feel inspired,
                    or emotionally connected leave the strongest impression on her.

                    Ida connects deeply with music—it reflects her mood, thoughts,
                    and emotions. One of her fun habits is replaying songs repeatedly
                    when they resonate with her feelings.
                </p>

                <p>
                    She may appear quiet at first, but once she feels comfortable,
                    her energetic and expressive personality shines through.
                    When she admires an artist, she fully immerses herself in their work.

                    Faizal Tahir is one of her favourites, and she has followed his music
                    since debut. Another memorable moment was discovering “About You”
                    by The 1975, a song she replayed countless times.

                    Tan Yee Jing has an interesting relationship with horror movies.
                    Even though they genuinely scare her, she still enjoys watching them.
                    Jumpscares always catch her off guard—especially when she least expects it.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <em>The Conjuring</em> left the strongest impression on her,
                    lingering long after the credits rolled.
                </p>

                <p>
                    She also has a very low humor threshold and laughs easily,
                    even at the smallest things, which often makes moments more fun
                    and lighthearted.

                <p>
                    Mayada is a computing student who believes movies can teach lessons
                    that go beyond textbooks. She enjoys analyzing character development,
                    motivations, and emotional growth within stories.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Inspirational films like <em>The Pursuit of Happyness</em>
                    resonate with her deeply, especially stories about perseverance
                    and personal growth.
                </p>

                <p>
                    By day, she codes and builds systems; by night, she enjoys movie
                    marathons—finding meaning where technology and storytelling meet.
