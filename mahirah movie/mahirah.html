            <h2>🎥 Movie Title</h2>
            <p>
                <strong>3 Idiots (2009)</strong> is a critically acclaimed Indian comedy-drama
                directed by Rajkumar Hirani. The film explores the realities of student life,
                academic pressure, friendship, and the definition of success in a highly competitive society.
            </p>
            <p>
                Although humorous and entertaining, the movie carries powerful messages
                about mental health, creativity, and personal happiness.

            <h3>🌟 Main Character I Admire</h3>
            <p>
                The character I admire the most is <strong>Rancho (Phunsukh Wangdu)</strong>.
                Rancho is intelligent, kind, and unconventional. Unlike others, he does not study
                merely to score high grades, but to understand concepts deeply.
            </p>
            <p>
                His courage to question rigid systems and support his friends emotionally
                makes him an inspiring role model.
            </p>

            <h3>📖 Movie Summary & Story Journey</h3>
            <p>
                The story follows three engineering students — Rancho, Farhan, and Raju —
                as they struggle through a demanding college environment that prioritizes ranks
                and marks over creativity and well-being.
            </p>
            <p>
                Throughout the film, they experience academic failure, family pressure,
                emotional breakdowns, and moments of joy. As the story unfolds,
                the characters learn to face their fears, redefine success,
                and support one another through life-changing challenges.

            <h3>🌱 Life Lessons & Personal Growth</h3>
            <p>
                One of the strongest lessons from this movie is the importance of mental health
                and self-belief. The film highlights how unrealistic expectations can deeply
                affect students emotionally.
            </p>
            <p>
                It teaches that passion, curiosity, and kindness are more important than
                societal approval or academic ranking.
